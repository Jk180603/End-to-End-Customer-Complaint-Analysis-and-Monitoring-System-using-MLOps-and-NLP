# End-to-End-Customer-Complaint-Analysis-and-Monitoring-System-using-MLOps-and-NLP

->End-to-end MLOps project for real-time customer complaint analysis using NLP. Includes data versioning (DVC), model tracking (MLflow), FastAPI for deployment, and a Streamlit dashboard for live monitoring of sentiment and complaint categories.

->This project is a complete MLOps pipeline for analyzing customer complaints in real time.
It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with MLOps tools like DVC and MLflow to build, track, and deploy sentiment and category classification models
